"Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Perceived Risk Theory (PRT)","Featherman, M.S., & Pavlou, P.A. (2003). Predicting e-services adoption: a perceived risk facets perspective. Int. J. Human-Computer Studies, 59, 451-474.","Two computer lab usability tests using vendor shopping trial demo software for e-billpay services
Sample 1: N=214
Sample 2: N=181
Undergraduate business students
25-minute ""shopping trial"" using interactive demo software
Paper and pencil survey after trial using 7-point Likert and semantic differential scales
Structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS
Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
Context: Internet-based bill payment services (EBPP or e-billpay)","Perceived risk reduced perceived usefulness and adoption intention
Performance, financial, privacy, and time risk were most salient facets
Social risk was not salient for this context
Perceived ease of use significantly reduced perceived risks of usage
Privacy risk emerged as an important inhibitor to system evaluation and adoption
Evidence for a second-order composite perceived risk variable
Evidence for a risk facet hierarchy with performance risk as foundation
Perceived ease of use primarily reduces performance risk concerns","Small sample sizes for SEM (sample to indicant ratios of 14.2:1 and 12.1:1)
Moderate collinearity among risk facets, contributing to indicant cross-loadings
Sample was younger, more educated, with higher computing skills than general population
Used original TAM, not TAM2 (2000 version)
Did not distinguish between risks attributable to Internet medium vs. e-service provider
Further scale development needed for increasingly divergent risk facet operationalizations"
